  * @brief     STM32F407xx Devices vector table for Atollic TrueSTUDIO toolchain. 
  *            This module performs:
  *                - Set the initial SP
  *                - Set the initial PC == Reset_Handler,
  *                - Set the vector table entries with the exceptions ISR address
  *                - Branches to main in the C library (which eventually
  *                  calls main()).
  *            After Reset the Cortex-M4 processor is in Thread mode,
  *            priority is Privileged, and the Stack is set to Main.
